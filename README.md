# multi-label-learn

mlleran is a python library for multi-label classification bulti on scikit-learn and numpy.

## Implementation
The implementation is based on the paper [A Review on Multi-Label Learning Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6471714/), and the implementated algorithms includes:
Problem Transformation
- [x] Binary Relevance
- [x] Classifier Chains
- [x] Calibrated Label Ranking
- [x] Random k-Labelsets
Algorithm Adaptation
- [x] Multi-Label k-Nearest Neighbor
- [x] Ranking Support Vector Machine
- [ ] Multi-Label Decision Tree
- [ ] Collective Multi-Label Classifier
